# Game Physics Assignment AIT
Second year end of semester assignment from the Physics side of my Game AI & Physics Module in AIT.

## [Assignment Brief]()
The objective of the Game Physics project is to develop a 2D game utilizing the Unity3D game engine. Due to the creative nature of game development, the theme of the application is at the discretion of the student. However, it is recommended that students consider the impact of design choices within the context of physics. For example, ice, sand, or water themed environments will provide opportunity to engage with alternative physics materials therefore mimicking the real-world counterparts. The following section outlines the project requirements:

#### Requirements
The 2D Game design should consists of:

• Character – A moveable player character, the character controller should
implement physics mechanics.

• Game Mechanics – The game mechanics should challenge the player to avoid
traps/enemies as they progress.

• Levels – The game mechanics should be implemented across a minimum of two
virtual worlds.

#### The following provides an overview of the physics-based requirements of the application.

• Colliders - All projects should implement a combination of collider types.
The game should incorporate a combination of three or more core lab learning
outcomes as per the list below:

• Triggers – Triggers can be utilized to trigger corresponding responses from the
game world, examples of such include activating weapons or triggering traps.
• Projectiles/Forces – The application of forces should be considered as a
method to produce projectiles which target the player location.

• Physics Materials – Materials can alter the movement and response within an
game application, students should place an emphasis on utilizing friction based
mechanics or bounce as an obstacle to challenge the player as they progress.

• Joints – There are a number of joints which allow developers to engage with
corresponding physics responses within the game world. Examples of such
include friction, hinge, slider, and spring joints. These should be included were
necessary to engage the player.

• Effectors – There are numerous effectors which can be utilized to emulate
physics. Students should consider the implementation of platform, surface, or
buoyancy effectors in their application to replicate real world responses
